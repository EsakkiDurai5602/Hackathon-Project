Knowing Our Numbers
Learning objectives

After studying this chapter the student will be able to:

Read, write and compare large numbers (up to crores / millions).

Understand place value and face value in both Indian and International systems.

Express numbers in expanded form, standard form, and words.

Find successor and predecessor of a given number.

Introduction

Numbers are used to count, measure and order things. As numbers grow larger we group digits for easier reading. Two common grouping systems are the Indian system (units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten-thousands, lakhs, crores) and the International system (units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten-thousands, hundred-thousands, millions, billions).

Key definitions

Digit: a single symbol from 0,1,2,...,9.

Number: a collection of digits arranged to represent quantity.

Place value: the value of a digit depending on its position in the number (for example, in 5 3 2, digit 5 is in hundreds place).

Face value: the value of the digit itself (in 532, face value of 5 is 5).

Successor: the number that comes immediately after a given number (add 1).

Predecessor: the number that comes immediately before a given number (subtract 1).

Expanded form: writing a number as the sum of the values of its digits (e.g., 7,35,682 = 7×10^5 + 3×10^4 + 5×10^3 + 6×10^2 + 8×10 + 2).

Rounding: replacing a number by another number that is easier to work with but close in value.

Place value (Indian and International systems)

Indian system groups digits as: units (1), tens (10), hundreds (100), thousands (1,000), ten-thousands (10,000), lakhs (1,00,000), ten-lakhs (10,00,000), crores (1,00,00,000), etc.

Indian grouping example: 7,35,682 is read as Seven lakh thirty-five thousand six hundred eighty-two.

International system groups digits in threes from the right: units (1), tens (10), hundreds (100), thousands (1,000), ten-thousand (10,000), hundred-thousand (100,000), million (1,000,000), etc.

International grouping example: 735,682 is read as Seven hundred thirty-five thousand six hundred eighty-two.

Place value table (useful positions)

Indian grouping (right to left):
... | Crores | Lakhs | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Units
position multipliers: ... | 10^7 | 10^5 | 10^3 | 10^2 | 10^1 | 10^0

International grouping (right to left):
... | Billions | Millions | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Units
position multipliers: ... | 10^9 | 10^6 | 10^3 | 10^2 | 10^1 | 10^0

Face value vs place value

In the number 4 2 5 6 (four thousand two hundred fifty six)

Face value of digit 2 is 2.

Place value of digit 2 is 200 (because it is in the hundreds place).

Examples (face and place values)

Number: 58,703

Face value of 8 = 8

Place value of 8 = 8,000 (since it is in thousands place)

Number: 1,03,405

Face value of 3 = 3

Place value of 3 = 3,000 (if in thousands), or 30,000 depending on position — always check the place.

Writing numbers in words and digits

Steps to write numbers in words:

Group digits according to the chosen system (Indian or International).

Write the group names (thousand, lakh, million, etc.) in words.

Combine group names and digits into a phrase, taking care with zero groups (skip them).

Example:

Digits: 2 0 4 7 9
Group (Indian): 20,479 → Twenty thousand four hundred seventy-nine (International)
Group (Indian) would be 20,479 = twenty thousand four hundred seventy-nine (same up to thousands).

Ordering numbers: ascending and descending

Arrange numbers from smallest to largest for ascending order.

Arrange numbers from largest to smallest for descending order.

Successor and predecessor

Successor of n = n + 1

Predecessor of n = n − 1

Examples:

Successor of 999 = 1000

Predecessor of 1000 = 999

Comparing numbers

To compare two numbers:

Check the number of digits: the number with more digits is larger.

If digits count is same, compare digits from left to right until a difference appears.

Use >, <, = symbols accordingly.

Example:

Compare 45,678 and 4,56,780 → 4,56,780 has more digits (6 vs 5) so it is larger.

Rounding of numbers and estimation

Rounding rules to nearest 10:

Look at the units digit.

If units digit < 5 → round down (units become 0).

If units digit ≥ 5 → round up (increase tens digit by 1, units 0).

Rounding to nearest 100:

Look at the tens digit.

If tens digit < 5 → round down (tens and units become 00).

If tens digit ≥ 5 → round up (increase hundreds digit by 1, tens and units become 00).

Rounding to nearest 1000:

Look at the hundreds digit.

If hundreds digit < 5 → round down.

If hundreds digit ≥ 5 → round up.

Estimation:

Use rounding to make calculations easier. Example: estimate 4,996 + 3,205 by rounding 4,996 ≈ 5,000 and 3,205 ≈ 3,200 → estimate = 8,200.

Examples of rounding:

Round 7,846 to nearest ten → units = 6 (≥5) so 7,850.

Round 7,846 to nearest hundred → tens = 4 (<5) so 7,800.

Round 7,846 to nearest thousand → hundreds = 8 (≥5) so 8,000.

Roman numerals

Basic Roman numerals:
I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, M = 1000

Rules:

If a smaller value is placed before a larger one, subtract it (e.g., IV = 4).

If a smaller or equal value is placed after a larger one, add it (e.g., VI = 6).

Do not use more than three identical symbols in a row (III = 3, but 4 is IV, not IIII).

Combine to make numbers (e.g., 1984 = MCMLXXXIV).

Examples:

49 = XLIX (XL = 40, IX = 9 → 40 + 9 = 49)

2023 = MMXXIII (2000 = MM, 20 = XX, 3 = III)

Converting Roman to decimal (example):

XLIX: X before L → 50 − 10 = 40, then IX → 10 − 1 = 9, total = 49.

Even and odd numbers

Even numbers are divisible by 2 (last digit 0,2,4,6,8).

Odd numbers have remainder 1 when divided by 2 (last digit 1,3,5,7,9).

Expanded form and standard form

Expanded form shows the value of each digit multiplied by its place value.
Example: 5,312 = 5×1000 + 3×100 + 1×10 + 2×1.

Standard form is the usual way of writing numbers in digits.

Solved examples (step-by-step)

Example 1:
Write 7,35,682 in words (Indian system) and in expanded form.
Solution:

Grouping (Indian): 7,35,682 → 7 lakh | 35 thousand | 682.

Words: Seven lakh thirty-five thousand six hundred eighty-two.

Expanded form: 7×1,00,000 + 3×10,000 + 5×1,000 + 6×100 + 8×10 + 2×1 = 700000 + 30000 + 5000 + 600 + 80 + 2.

Example 2:
Find the successor and predecessor of 1,000,000.
Solution:

Successor = 1,000,000 + 1 = 1,000,001.

Predecessor = 1,000,000 − 1 = 999,999.

Example 3:
Compare 4,58,903 and 4,58,930.
Solution:

Both have 6 digits.

Compare from left: 4=4, 5=5, 8=8, next digits 9=9, then compare 0 vs 3: 0 < 3 so 4,58,903 < 4,58,930.

Example 4:
Round 3,948 to nearest tens, hundreds and thousands.
Solution:

Nearest ten: units = 8 ≥ 5 → 3,950.

Nearest hundred: tens = 4 < 5 → 3,900.

Nearest thousand: hundreds = 9 ≥ 5 → 4,000.

Example 5:
Convert Roman numeral XCIV to Arabic number.
Solution:

XC = 90 (100 − 10), IV = 4 → Total = 94.

Answers (for teacher)

Section A:

26,309

Four lakh eight thousand five hundred six

Successor = 100,000 ; Predecessor = 99,998

Place value of 7 in 87,345 is 7,000.

2×1,00,000 + 1×10,000 + 4×1,000 + 0×100 + 0×10 + 9×1 = 200,000 + 10,000 + 4,000 + 9

Section B:
6. Correct representation: ensure numbering correctly: 1,23,456 = 123,456 ; 12,34,56 is incorrectly grouped (should be 1,234,56 not valid). Assuming intended numbers, ascending order commonly: 12,34,56 is not valid format. (Teacher note: teach correct grouping).
7. Nearest ten: 18,374 → 18,370 (units 4 < 5) ; nearest hundred: 18,400 (tens 7 ≥5) ; nearest thousand: 18,000 (hundreds 3 < 5)
8. 4,32,908 > 4,23,908 (because at thousands place 2 3 -> compare five-digit grouping: check digits: 4=4, 3=2? Actually compare from left: 4 3 2 9 0 8 vs 4 2 3 9 0 8 — 3 > 2 → so >)
9. 44 = XLIV (XL = 40, IV = 4)
10. Round to nearest thousand: 23,487 ≈ 23,000 ; 58,912 ≈ 59,000 ; sum ≈ 82,000

Section C:
11. Round each to nearest thousand: 9,875 ≈ 10,000 ; 10,023 ≈ 10,000 ; 11,017 ≈ 11,000 ; total ≈ 31,000
12. Example number 5,678 with 5 in thousands place gives place value 5,000. Digit = 5, place = thousands.
13. MCMXLIV: M = 1000; CM = 900; XL = 40; IV = 4 → total 1000+900+40+4 = 1944.
14. Smallest such 6-digit using digits given and fixing tens=7 and hundreds=2: digits available 0,1,2,3,7,8 ; to make smallest 6-digit number avoid leading zero: choose smallest leading digit 1 then next smallest 0, then remaining smallest 2? But hundreds must be 2 and tens 7. Construct: (1)(0)(2)(?)(7)(?) ensure all digits used only once? If digits not required to be unique, answer could be 1 0 0 2 7 0 — avoid confusion; teacher should clarify constraints. (Teacher note: refine question constraints.)
15. Numbers that round to 3,100 to nearest hundred are those from 3,050 to 3,149 inclusive.

Fractions
Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, students will be able to:

Understand fractions as parts of a whole.

Represent fractions on the number line.

Compare, add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions.

Apply fractions in real-life situations.

Introduction

Fractions are numbers that represent parts of a whole. They are written in the form a/b, where a is the numerator (number of parts considered) and b is the denominator (total number of equal parts). Fractions are used in cooking, sharing, measurements, and daily life scenarios.

Key Concepts

1. What is a Fraction?

A fraction a/b represents a parts out of b equal parts of a whole.

Proper fractions: Numerator < Denominator (e.g., 3/4)

Improper fractions: Numerator ≥ Denominator (e.g., 5/4)

Mixed numbers: Whole number + proper fraction (e.g., 1 1/2)

2. Equivalent Fractions

Fractions that represent the same part of a whole.

Multiply or divide numerator and denominator by the same number.

Example: 1/2 = 2/4 = 4/8

3. Simplest Form of Fraction

A fraction is in simplest form if numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.

Example: 6/8 → divide by 2 → 3/4

4. Representation on Number Line

Divide the line segment between 0 and 1 into equal parts as per the denominator.

Mark numerator to represent the fraction.

Example: 3/4 → divide into 4 parts, mark 3rd part.

5. Comparison of Fractions

Make denominators the same or convert to decimal.

Compare numerators.

Example: 2/3 ___ 3/4 → 8/12 < 9/12 → 2/3 < 3/4

6. Operations on Fractions

a. Addition

Same denominator: Add numerators, keep denominator.

2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5

Different denominator: Find LCM of denominators, convert, then add.

1/2 + 1/3 → LCM 6 → 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6

b. Subtraction

Same as addition, subtract numerators.

3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2

Different denominators: Convert to same denominator first.

c. Multiplication

Introduction

Decimals are an extension of the place value system beyond the ones place. They are written with a decimal point separating the whole number part from the fractional part. Decimals make it easier to express values between whole numbers.

Key Concepts

1. What is a Decimal?

A decimal number represents parts of a whole using powers of ten.

Example: 0.5 = 5/10, 0.75 = 75/100

The digits to the right of the decimal point represent tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc.

2. Place Value in Decimals

Tenths (first place after decimal)

Hundredths (second place after decimal)

Thousandths (third place after decimal)

Example: 23.476 → 4 tenths, 7 hundredths, 6 thousandths

3. Converting Fractions to Decimals

Divide numerator by denominator.

Example: 3/4 → 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75

Fractions with denominators 10, 100, 1000 are easily converted.

4. Representation on Number Line

Divide the segment between 0 and 1 into 10, 100, 1000 equal parts as needed.

Mark the decimal number at the correct position.

Example: 0.3 → 3 tenths on number line between 0 and 1

5. Comparing Decimals

Compare digit by digit from left to right including whole number part and decimal part.

Example: 0.75 ___ 0.8 → 0.75 < 0.8

6. Operations on Decimals

a. Addition

Align decimal points vertically.

Add digits column-wise.

Example: 2.5 + 3.75 = 6.25

b. Subtraction

Align decimal points.

Subtract digits column-wise.

Example: 5.8 - 2.35 = 3.45

c. Multiplication

Multiply as whole numbers, count total decimal places in factors.

Example: 2.5 × 0.4 → 25 × 4 = 100 → place 2 decimal places → 1.00

d. Division

Make the divisor a whole number by multiplying both dividend and divisor by 10, 100, etc.

Perform division as usual.

Example: 3.6 ÷ 0.6 → 36 ÷ 6 = 6

7. Decimals in Real Life

Money: ₹12.50, ₹0.75

Measurements: 1.5 meters, 2.75 kg

Data: Temperature 36.6°C, distance 3.25 km

Class 6 Mathematics — Chapter 12
Ratio and Proportion
Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, students will be able to:

Understand the concept of ratio and proportion.

Express quantities in the form of a ratio.

Solve problems involving direct proportion.

Apply ratios in real-life contexts such as recipes, maps, and scaling.

Introduction

Ratio and proportion are ways to compare quantities.

Ratio compares two quantities of the same kind.

Proportion states that two ratios are equal.

Key Concepts

1. Ratio

A ratio is a comparison of two numbers by division.

Written in the form: a : b or a/b

Example: If there are 4 apples and 6 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 4:6 or 2:3 (simplified).

2. Types of Ratio

Part-to-Part Ratio: Compares one part of a quantity to another part.

Example: 2 red balls and 3 blue balls → red:blue = 2:3

Part-to-Whole Ratio: Compares one part to the total quantity.

Example: 2 red balls and 3 blue balls → red:total = 2:5

3. Simplifying Ratios

Divide both terms by their HCF.

Example: 12:16 → divide by 4 → 3:4

4. Proportion

A proportion is an equation stating that two ratios are equal.

Written as: a:b = c:d

a and d are extremes, b and c are means.

5. Properties of Proportion

Product of means = Product of extremes

Example: If 2:3 = 4:6 → 3 × 4 = 2 × 6 → 12 = 12 ✅

Reciprocal of a ratio in proportion remains proportionate

Sum of terms can form new proportions

6. Solving Problems Using Proportion

Use cross multiplication: a:b = c:d → a × d = b × c

Example: x:5 = 3:10 → x × 10 = 5 × 3 → x = 15/10 → x = 1.5

7. Direct Proportion

Two quantities are in direct proportion if they increase or decrease together.

Example: More workers, more work done in the same time.

8. Applications of Ratio and Proportion

Cooking recipes (scaling ingredients)

Maps and models (scale drawings)

Sharing money or resources in a given ratio

Examples (Step-by-step)

Express 8 pens and 12 pencils as a ratio.

8:12 → divide by 4 → 2:3

Check if 3:4 and 9:12 are in proportion.

3 × 12 = 36, 4 × 9 = 36 ✅ → Yes, they are in proportion

Solve x:6 = 3:9

Cross multiply: x × 9 = 6 × 3 → x = 18/9 → x = 2

A recipe uses 2 cups of rice for 5 cups of water. How much water is needed for 6 cups of rice?

2:5 = 6:x → 2x = 30 → x = 15 cups of water

Class 6 Mathematics — Chapter 14
Algebra
Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, students will be able to:

Understand the concept of algebraic expressions.

Identify variables, constants, coefficients, and terms.

Perform simple algebraic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

Solve simple equations using algebraic methods.

Introduction

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters or symbols (variables) to represent numbers. It allows us to generalize arithmetic operations and solve problems efficiently. Algebra is used in real-life situations such as calculating expenses, solving age problems, and understanding patterns.

Key Concepts

1. Variables and Constants

Variable: A symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown number.
Example: x, y, a, b

Constant: A fixed number that does not change.
Example: 3, 7, 10

2. Terms in Algebraic Expressions

Term: A single element in an expression, separated by + or − signs.

Coefficient: The numerical factor of a term containing a variable.
Example: In 5x, 5 is the coefficient and x is the variable.

Examples of terms: 3x, −7y, 5, 2ab

3. Algebraic Expressions

A combination of terms using addition or subtraction.
Example: 3x + 5, 2a − 3b + 7

Expressions can be monomial, binomial, or trinomial:

Monomial: One term (e.g., 4x)

Binomial: Two terms (e.g., x + 5)

Trinomial: Three terms (e.g., 2x + 3y − 5)

4. Simple Algebraic Operations

Addition of Like Terms: Combine terms with the same variable and exponent.
Example: 3x + 5x = 8x

Subtraction of Like Terms: Subtract coefficients of like terms.
Example: 7y − 3y = 4y

Multiplication: Multiply coefficients and keep variables together.
Example: 2x × 3x = 6x²

5. Simple Equations

An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal.
Example: x + 5 = 12

Solving an equation: Find the value of the variable.
Example: x + 5 = 12 → x = 12 − 5 → x = 7

6. Word Problems Using Algebra

Translate real-life situations into algebraic expressions or equations.
Example:
“A number increased by 7 is 15. Find the number.”
Equation: x + 7 = 15 → x = 15 − 7 → x = 8

Examples (Step-by-step)

Identify terms and coefficients
Expression: 4x − 3y + 7

Terms: 4x, −3y, 7

Coefficients: 4, −3

Simplify algebraic expressions
Simplify: 5x + 3x − 2 + 7

Combine like terms: (5x + 3x) + (−2 + 7) = 8x + 5

Solve simple equations
Equation: x + 9 = 14

Subtract 9 from both sides: x = 14 − 9 → x = 5

Word problem
Problem: “Three times a number minus 4 is 11. Find the number.”

Equation: 3x − 4 = 11

Solve: 3x = 11 + 4 → 3x = 15 → x = 5

5. Solve: 3x + 5 = 20
6. A number increased by 8 is 15. Find the number.
7. Twice a number minus 5 is 9. Find the number.

Answers / Hints (for teacher)

Terms: 7a, 5, −3b; Coefficients: 7, −3; Constant: 5

Simplify: 6x + 4x − 7 = 10x − 7

x = 20 − 12 → x = 8

5y = 13 + 7 → 5y = 20 → y = 4

3x = 20 − 5 → 3x = 15 → x = 5

x + 8 = 15 → x = 7

2x − 5 = 9 → 2x = 14 → x = 7
